_**Static Websites Hosted on AWS ☁️**_

In this repository, I showcase two static websites that I've hosted on **Amazon Web Services (AWS S3)**, demonstrating my proficiency in cloud storage and website hosting. These projects reflect my hands-on experience in web development and deployment using cloud technologies.

1. **Bookstore Website 📚**:  
   This project is a simple yet functional **Bookstore Website** designed to provide an online shopping experience for books. The website showcases the basics of e-commerce site structure, including navigation, product display, and an intuitive layout.

   A replica of my college's website, developed to demonstrate my understanding of **web technologies** and the **AWS platform**. This project highlights my ability to structure websites effectively and replicate real-world web designs.

These projects not only show my skills in **front-end web development** but also highlight my ability to use **cloud hosting solutions** (like **AWS S3**) for scalable website deployment.
